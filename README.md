# Nuclei Segmentation with Machine Learning

This repository contains code for a nuclei segmentation project conducted as part of the Quantitative Microscopy course at Charles University. The project focuses on segmenting nuclei in microscopy images using the [APOC (Accelerated Pixel and Object Classification)](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/apoc) package. The dataset used for this analysis is the [Kaggle 2018 Data Science Bowl dataset](https://github.com/lopuhin/kaggle-dsbowl-2018-dataset-fixes/tree/master), enhanced with improved annotations.
